SciPy 0.10.1 Release Notes
==========================

.. contents::

SciPy 0.10.1 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 0.10.0.  

Main changes
------------

The most important changes are::

1. The single precision routines of ``eigs`` and ``eigsh`` in
   ``scipy.sparse.linalg`` have been disabled (they internally use double
   precision now).
2. A compatibility issue related to changes in NumPy macros has been fixed, in
   order to make scipy 0.10.1 compile with the upcoming numpy 1.7.0 release.


Other issues fixed
