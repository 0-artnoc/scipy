SciPy 0.15.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.15.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.15.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.15.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

Linear Programming Interface
````````````````````````````

``scipy.optimize.linprog`` now provides a generic
linear programming similar to the way `scipy.optimize.minimize`
provides a generic interface to nonlinear programming optimizers. 
Currently the only method supported is *simplex* which provides
a two-phase, dense-matrix-based simplex algorithm. Callbacks 
functions are supported,allowing the user to monitor the progress 
of the algorithm.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

scipy.ndimage
-------------

The functions ``scipy.ndimage.minimum_positions``,
``scipy.ndimage.maximum_positions`` and ``scipy.ndimage.extrema`` return
positions as ints instead of floats.
