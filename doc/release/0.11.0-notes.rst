SciPy 0.11.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.11.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.11.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.11.x branch, and on adding
new features on the development trunk.

This release requires Python 2.4-2.7 or 3.1- and NumPy 1.X.X or greater.


New features
============

Unified interface to minimizers of multivariate functions (``scipy.optimize``)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new function ``scipy.optimize.minimize`` was added to provide a common
interface to minimizers of multivariate functions (unconstrained: `fmin`,
`fmin_powell`, `fmin_cg`, `fmin_ncg`, `fmin_bfgs` and `anneal` or
constrained: `fmin_l_bfgs_b`, `fmin_tnc`, `fmin_cobyla` and `fmin_slsqp`).
This allows for easier comparing and switching between solvers.


Constructing sparse matrices
----------------------------

Two new functions, ``scipy.sparse.diags`` and ``scipy.sparse.block_diag``, were
added to easily construct diagonal and block-diagonal sparse matrices
respectively.


Pascal matrix function
----------------------

A function for creating Pascal matrices, ``scipy.linalg.pascal``, was added.


``scipy.misc.logsumexp``
------------------------

``misc.logsumexp`` now takes an optional ``axis`` keyword argument.

Sparse Graph Submodule
----------------------
The new submodule :mod:`scipy.sparse.csgraph` implements a number of efficient
graph algorithms for graphs stored as sparse adjacency matrices.  Available
routines are:

   - :func:`connected_components` - determine connected components of a graph
   - :func:`laplacian` - compute the laplacian of a graph
   - :func:`shortest_path` - compute the shortest path between points on a
     positive graph
   - :func:`dijkstra` - use Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path
   - :func:`floyd_warshall` - use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for
     shortest path
   - :func:`breadth_first_order` - compute a breadth-first order of nodes
   - :func:`depth_first_order` - compute a depth-first order of nodes
   - :func:`breadth_first_tree` - construct the breadth-first tree from
     a given node
   - :func:`depth_first_tree` - construct a depth-first tree from a given node
   - :func:`minimum_spanning_tree` - construct the minimum spanning
     tree of a graph


Deprecated features
===================
``scipy.sparse.cs_graph_components`` has been made a part of the sparse graph
submodule, and renamed to ``scipy.sparse.csgraph.connected_components``.
Calling the former routine will result in a deprecation warning.
